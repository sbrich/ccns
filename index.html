integration of multi-scale neuroscience data</strong></em> - encompassing <strong>genetics</strong>, <strong>brain structure and function</strong>, and <strong>cognition</strong> –
designed to introduce participants to the concepts and methods behind psychiatric neuroinformatics. Daily sessions will
include both didactic teaching and hands-on tutorial components aimed at engaging critical thinking and developing
practical skills in key selected areas. Through a series of experiments using real-world data types, participants will
uncover the links between modalities of human genomics, neuronal electrophysiology, structural and functional
neuroimaging, and observed behaviour that KCNI scientists are integrating to study mental illness.</p><p>All participants will take part in each full day of training. While the course is designed with a unified dataset and shared
series of tutorials, students will have the opportunity for <em>project-specific discussions</em>, <em>collaboration</em>, and <em>guidance</em>
outside of structured time. Lectures will be led by members and affiliates of the KCNI team, including faculty at the
University of Toronto’s Department of Psychiatry.</p><p>This unique course will prepare participants to handle and analyze multiple data types in hopes that their own research
may benefit from collaborative, multi-modal approaches. Critically, participants will also learn about best practices for
data management and quality control in the context of integrative analysis.</p></article><article id=02-topics><h1>02-Topics</h1><figure class="image main"><img src=/images/brain_circuit_modelling.jpg></figure><h2 id=major-topics-covered>Major topics covered:</h2><ul><li><strong>Psychiatric epidemiology</strong> and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness</li><li><strong>Psychiatric genetics</strong>, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function</li><li><strong>Neuronal population activity</strong> in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic</li><li><strong>Whole-brain</strong> meso-scale structural and functional variation</li><li>Bayesian models of <strong>perception and learning;</strong> applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography</li><li><strong>Population-based subtyping</strong> and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts</li><li><strong>Putting it all together:</strong> using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with
