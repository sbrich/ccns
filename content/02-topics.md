## Major topics covered:

- **Psychiatric epidemiology** and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness  
- **Psychiatric genetics**, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function  
- **Neuronal population activity** in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic  
- **Whole-brain** meso-scale structural and functional variation  
- Bayesian models of **perception and learning;** applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography
- **Population-based subtyping** and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts  
- **Putting it all together:** using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with
distinct symptomatic and functional trajectories using biostatistical approaches
